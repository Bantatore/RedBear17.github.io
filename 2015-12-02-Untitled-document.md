Today in the lesson, we talked about trusting websites(like Wikipedia) and trusting well known websites (BBC). You can actually trust Wikipedia, even though some people don't, as a group of "nerds" go through the site and check that everything is true and change it if it is not.

Also, we talked about scams and hacks.There are white hackers, who do legal scams to protect people, there are grey hackers, who do illegal scams but for good reasons (like hacking the government profiles to get news that people think the public should know) and there are black hackers, who do illegal hacks for wrong reasons.

You can have pop-up scams, where tabs pop-up on the screen and you click on them (it could say if you click on the link you win an iphone 6s+). Once you click on it, it would say enter your email and you pay a deposit of ?50 for example. No one ever wins anything and the scammers get a free ?50 and your email that they can sell on to criminal and other scammers.
