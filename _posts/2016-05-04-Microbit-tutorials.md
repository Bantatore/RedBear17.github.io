In today's lesson, we did lots of microbit tutorials. These tutorials are really useful as they donâ€™t just give you the way to program it, they say how it works and why you need certain parts. From this I have learnt so much more on how to program and it makes programming so much easier.

The tutorials tell you what to do and will highlight what is wrong if you do mistakes. However, it does challenge you once you have gone through a couple of the tutorials by not letting the program help you-you only have the booklet as assistance. I would recommend these tutorials.

As you can see, it definitely makes coding much easier. You do not have to sit there for hours on end trying stuff when you have the basics in front of you. I would recommend trying it as it really helped me out and I am sure it will help you.
