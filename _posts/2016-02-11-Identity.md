Everyone has an identity. It shows who you are. Your personality, your dreams and what you like is just a few things your identity contains. However, your identity on social media can be different to your identity in the "real world".

Online, you are more likely to act in stupid ways than you are in real life. For example, you would not go up to someone in real life and call them bad things, however on media some people do what they want.

You may also act in different ways and "like" different things than you do in real life. You may like ballet in real life but online you don't show your true self and like what your friends think is “cool”. This is showing a fake identity.

You should always like what you always like and don't get forced into doing something to look cool online. Don’t worry if your friends judge you if you do something you like as they won’t actually be your real friends. So, do what you like!
