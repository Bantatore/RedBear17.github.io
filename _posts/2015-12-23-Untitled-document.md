**_Binary_**

Binary and Hex is what computers use to do everything. Binary code is a system of representing numbers, letters, images, sounds and colours. Amazingly, it uses only two types of information to do this (1 and 0). 

To help explain, here are the  first 15 numbers of binary:

0,1,10,11,100,101,110,111,1000,1001,1010,1011,1100,1101,1110,1111

As you can see, the binary system counts up in a logical order, whenever a number made up of entirely 1's is reached, an extra digit(0) is added. This is exactly the same thing that happens in the decimal system when a number made up of entirely 9?s is reached.

However, binary numbers in a computing context are always represented in 8 digits, therefore 8 binary digits form one byte. There is 255 bits(the smallest amount of storage) in a byte. In binary 11111111=255.So, there is(in binary) 11111111 bits in a byte.

This is a table translating decimal                                                                                                       into hex and binary.                                 

**_Hexadecimal(Hex)_**

The hexadecimal system, or hex system, is closely related to the binary system. Here's why.

To represent the number 255 in binary, it takes 8 digits. That's a lot, considering the decimal system only needs 3 digits to represent 255. However, the hex system goes one step further and allows the number 255 to be represented in only two digits.

This is because the hex system is base-sixteen, and 162 = 256.This means, the highest number that can be represented with two digits in hex is 255. In other words, any 8-digit binary byte can be represented as a 2-digit hex byte.This is great for both computers and humans. For computers, it saves space, and for humans, it improves readability. Hex uses numbers 0-9 and letters A-F.

 This is why colour codes are, for example,#FFFFFF=White. All the letters and numbers can make colours.A computer can produce 16.8 million colours. This is because 255x255x255=18.6 billion. If the computer had more storage it could have more colours.
