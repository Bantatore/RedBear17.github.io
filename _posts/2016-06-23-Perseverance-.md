Perseverance is key in life(especially in computer programming). To get anywhere, you got to work hard and struggle through with problems as we are not perfect and have troubles doing stuff, however what separates good and outstanding people are if they can persevere and work out their problems.

You should never give up on something and expect others to do your work for you, at least you should try and ask for advice with proof you have done everything you can to solve the problem. You get more praise and self-belief if you work out your own problems and probably your work will be better. 

That is why you should always persevere through your problems. It helps you more than getting your teacher to do your work. So, you should always persevere and you will get the answer in the end.
