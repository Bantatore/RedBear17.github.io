Learning is crucial in life. However, it is how you learn that is most important.You can not take infomation in and then just ask stupid questions during lesson times. You should think for yourself and work things out for. Good learning habits will do you good in life so I will tell you about them.

Asking questions that have an obvious answer or that the teacher has answered just annoys the teacher and wastes your learning time. Think for yourself and try to do something about your problem before rushing off to the teacher for help. I am not saying you can not ask questions but ask clever questions that are to do with the task and not ones that the teacher has answered.

You should also do what the teacher asks. Do exactly what they ask and no less. However, you can do more if it is related to the subject as the teacher will like that. You should also be on good behaviour and not mess around in lesson times. This annoys the teacher and you will get in trouble and lose your learning time.

These are good learning habits and will get you far in life. They will make you learn more and make you a polite person. I hope you will act like this in your life.
