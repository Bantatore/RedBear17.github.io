In today's lesson we learned all about microbits and computer programming language vocabulary. Every school in the country gets one and you can use it to do anything you imagine. It can tell your mood, become a fortune teller or even become a random name generator. They are very cool.

When programming a microbit, you can use several different programming languages-Touchdevelop, Block editor, Javascript and Python. Some of these languages are easier than others but do an equally good job.

However, before programming, you need to know vocabulary that will appear often in your coding. Here is a list of word and there meanings that will appear in your coding:

String: This is a group of words that don't mean anything to the computer but to the person viewing your software.

Integer: An integer is a number.

Output:This is where information leaves the system.

Input: This is where information leaves the system.

Draw: When the software shows a word/words on the screen for the viewer.

This is what happened in the lesson. I hope you have learned something new and keep coding.
