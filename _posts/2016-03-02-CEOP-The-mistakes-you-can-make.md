On the internet, you can make mistakes. They are sometimes harmless, however they can be catastrophic. You could be challenging your friends and put it online,  then the whole world would know what you did. I could not mean anything but what if it did. This blog will tell you a situation you could be in and what to do.

You could challenge your friends to who can get the most views on youtube. You might not realise it when doing it, but when you reflect on it, you probably would of done stupid things you would not do in your right mind. It might be harmless online if you did something like the cinnamon challenge. However, you could of done something like run around naked. If this happens, you will probably get teased, bullied or even worse, attract a peodophile.

If it comes to this stage, you should tell a parent, teacher or CEOP(Child Exploitation and Online Protection). CEOP is a crime fighting agency that will help you if you get into sexual trouble(the example above). They will help you as best they can and give you support.

To conclude, if you get into a sticky situation, get help from people you trust and CEOP. However, to prevent you from getting into this mess, be sensible and think before you act. It may seem cool to do it but it is really not. Stay safe or you will be sorry.
