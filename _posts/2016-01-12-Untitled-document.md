In today's lesson, we discussed E-safety. This is a broader topic than what I am specifically talking about today as I am talking about grooming and peodophiles. Most people know what a peodophiles is so I will explain what grooming is. Grooming is when someone changes your point of view of something over a long period of time to make a person do something. For example, if someone on the internet wanted you to join a terrorist group. They might talk to you online and gain your trust, then maybe tell you things that make you think terrorists are good and you believe it. Then you might do a terrorist act. That is grooming. 

Peodophiles use grooming to get thier victims. Another stratergy peodophiles use, is sending child pornography or pornograpghy in gerneral. It is against the law to send pictures to children under the age of 16 that people would find attracting(adults can be tricked by this as well), but they only send the picture to get the person to meet them and then the peodophile does what ever he/she wants the victim to do. It is also illegal to have sex with a person under the age of 16 with an adult. Also, if a child aged 10-12 tries to have sex with a child under 10 are sent to prison straight away without going to court.

To prevent peodophiles grooming you, you must put as least information about yourself online as you can.You can still talk to people you know and have seen in person, however if a stranger tries to talk to you or he/she is sending you inappropiate messages, tell someone you trust like a teacher, a parent or the police. Don't put your actual full name as your username, use a nickname. Don’t use the same password for everything and don’t make it simple to decode. Have different passwords at least 8 characters long. Don’t put your email address, your home address or any information you don’t want anyone else to know online. People could find where you live, hack and/or spam your emails and know personal information.On social media, you can put a setting on that lets only your friends see what you post which is useful if you post a lot about where you go out and other things like that. That is how you can stay safe on the internet without peodophiles stopping you having fun!
