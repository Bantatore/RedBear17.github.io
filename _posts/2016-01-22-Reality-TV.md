Reality TV, is a huge part of the television industry. The dictionaries definition on Reality TV is "television programmes in which ordinary people are continuously filmed, designed to be entertaining rather than informative." However, is this true? Is it scripted?Is it just ordinary people? Well let's find out!

In Reality TV, it is not just normal people. It can film celebrities (Celebrity Big Brother) or can have ordinary people on a mission(Biggest Loser). It can be both.

Do you think people on Reality TV act as they would with your friends? To answer this question, imagine you are taking a photo and putting it on facebook, for example. You would do a cheesy smile. However, when you are walking down the street you don't do that cheesy smile all the time. So, on reality TV they try to look cool and try to be better than they are so the public likes them.

Is Reality TV scripted? It is not. They are told where to go but what they say and do, it is up to the people being filmed. However, if the camera crew wants something refilmed, it is refilmed. So, I guess, it is half scripted as they can refilm events and tweak some things to make it interesting.

Now you have seen what Reality Tv really is, you will think that they were told to say that or they are just trying to impress you before, if you can, vote for someone to be eliminated. They are probably like you and me but being pressured to do things.
