Online social Media is amazing. The advantages of it are so many, however there are equal disadvantages to social media. So, this blog post will show what the advantages and disadvantages are using social media. So, let's get started!

One of the advantages of social media is contacting people. You can contact old friends you can't see anymore, you communicate to people all over the world,you can find new people to date or to find clients,you can use it for emergencies and help,it is very useful to disabled people and old people who canâ€™t get out of the house and mass messaging. This is only under contacts.

Social media can be educational. Learning websites (like memrise), school classrooms(like google classroom) and even an email accounts that you own that your teachers can inform you about work. 

However, recruiting people is in the middle; it is an advantage and a disadvantage. You can hire people easily and look at CV's and their history in an instant. Sadly, this can be used to corrupt people. For example, ISIS can recruit people by vidios twisting their view on something to make them do something wrong. This is called grooming.

Grooming can also be used online by differents types of people. Not a terrorist, but a peodofile. They can use images or videos to to get people to do as they say. The peodofile would normally say to go to a location where the peodofile would kidnap them and do what they want with them.

Also, it may seem much, pictures of people just living a good life is an advantage and a disadvantage. It is an advantage when it makes people happy and your friends know what what you're doing and are glad for you. However, when people get jealous of you, it is a disadvantage. People can go mad or depressed by just seeing someone happy.

As you can see, social media is a useful source of media. You can use it for work, to meet up with your friends or to learn. However, in the wrong hand, or eyes, it can corrupt people and can be fatal. Media changes people's lives;that's a fact!
