Sexting and revenge porn are similar things but for two different age groups, they are both wrong to do and hurt people's feeling and normally the victim is scared for life on the inside. This blog will explain what sexting and revenge porn is and why it is bad.

Let's start with revenge porn.  Revenge porn is when a person is posting, texting or emailing inappropriate photos of people(normally naked or private parts in the picture) without the other person's(the victim in the photo) permission with intent to cause distress. It is normally people who have been dumped and want to get** ****REVENGE **on the person by humiliating them. It can be pornography or sexy selfies but either way it is sent to people and put on social media to humiliate someone.

 A law has been put against this act-Revenge Pornography law by the CPS(Crown Prosecution Service). However, it has become even more common after the law was put in place. It is a very serious offence and can give you a life sentence in jail.

Next, we will talk about sexting. Sexting is when you text or email(normally text) a picture of yourself or you receive a picture of someone naked or of the private body parts. These pictures are designed to make you attracted to it and you want more. If you want more they can groom you or you could go to prison as well as where if you are sexting back at them to get more. This is mainly done by teenagers (11-16 year olds). It is a child's version of pornography. This is illegal for children under the age of 16 to do.  It is scary that 60% of teenagers have received or sent a picture that falls into the category of sexting. It has become increasingly more popular to do it over the years. To make sure you don't get involved in it is that if you receive a picture that is "sexy" just tell a teacher or your parents and they can sort it out for you.

As you can see, sexting and revenge porn are very similar, they are both illegal for there age groups and both hurt people's feelings. That is why, whatever you do, you do not do sexting or revenge porn.
