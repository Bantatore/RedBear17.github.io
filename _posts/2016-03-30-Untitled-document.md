Presentations can be really dull and boring. Slides full of words, no colour and the presenter reading of the board. If this is what you did for your job you would probably get fired. This is why Powerpoint is not that good for presentations. To improve your presentation skills you can use Prezi.

On Prezi you can make presentations very interesting. Slides don't just move to the right, they can go left, up, down- they can go anywhere. You can zoom in and out. This will keep the audience focused on your presentation and keep them entertained.

However, all of this is useless if you just write paragraphs about what you are going to talk about and even worse, just reading your presentation. You have to know how to present before presenting.

As you can see, Prezi is the much better alternative to Powerpoint. There is so much more you can do with Prezi. However most importantly, you should always write in bullet points in  presentations. Don't just write paragraphs. That is how you can become the best presenter.
