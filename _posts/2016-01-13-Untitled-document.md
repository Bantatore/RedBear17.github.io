Media comes in all differents shapes and sizes and format. Media is when information is being shared with someone. Paintings are media as the artist is communicating with you on how the picture looks, newspapers are media, emails are media talking is a form of media, TV is media, sending a letter is a form of media, however social media is the most recent type. Social media includes facebook, twitter, instagram, facebook and any website where you can chat to people and/or follow people.

On television adverts, or any advert, they try to convince you that there product is the best. It does not intentionally make you buy the product straight away, just when you need to buy, a car for example, that brand will pop up in your head and you are more likely to buy that brand than any other. There are three main topics that you can break an advert down with and find what the company wants the reader/viewer to think:

Watch the vidio first: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_DIvRKPsH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_DIvRKPsHU)

.Who is the target audience? 

The target audience is what age category the advert is for and the gender it is for. In the video above, the target audience is males aged 20-30 or adults with children. The video would get men to buy the car as at the end the girls liked the hamsters when they came out of the car. Also, children would like the hamsters and tell their parents and that might inspire them to buy it as their kids like it. 

.What is the subtext(hidden message)?

The subliminal message is what the company wants you to think, that is what the subtext is. The reason you should buy the product and what it will do for you. For example, the video shows you can get better if you get the car. You will be improved as the hamsters are. More people will like you and you will become popular.

.What are the untold stories

The untold stories are what the advert suggests to audience but does not say.In the advert, it suggests that being fat is bad but in the gym other people did not hate on them for being fat. When they got fit, more and more people liked them. Like the car, some people liked the car, but now after it being upgraded, more and more people would like the car.

Most adverts that are really successful, show a transformation between the product(the car) and the main characters in the advert( the hamsters). They normally link to many real life scenarios abouting making people better(people trying to get fit). It makes people then think that buying the product will make themselves be better ( in this case, it is getting slim).  

Media literacy is the ability to access, analyze, evaluate, and create media. Media literates can understand the complex messages we receive from television, radio, Internet, newspapers, magazines, books, billboards, video games, music, and all other forms of media. Media affects our everyday lives. How we talk, think and see people and the world. All media tries to persuade us to do and/or think something. Media is a powerful thing and can makes us do unwise acts or on the other hand, light up our imagination. For example, by watching a television programme, it could suggest being gay and black is wrong and you could believe it. Or, you might see something that gives you an idea that could change the world. Media literacy helps you break down media and find the messages being put across by companies/producers and the untold stories/subtext in adverts, newspapers etcâ€¦

As you can see, media is a powerful thing that really controls our whole perspective on life. In the wrong hands, it is very dangerous make makes people do stupid things. However, it can change lives and even the world. On television, art works, letters, music and even pigeons with letters, media is still the same; changing our view on incidents for ever.
