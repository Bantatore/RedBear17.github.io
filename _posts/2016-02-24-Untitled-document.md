When you put things on social media, you always get comments- sometimes they are good and sometimes they are bad.When I did my Identity map, I got positive constructive criticism comments, some stupid comments but not any rude fortunately. In this blog will say what I think about the comments people made on my identity map.

Let's start of with the positive comments. Many people said that I spent lots of time on my work and it looked neat. People said my colouring was outstanding. People gave me constructive criticism. This was good as they told me improvements I could make in a non-rude way. For example, people told me to do more writing in a polite way.

However sadly, people were being just plain idiots. Some people said "It says religion but there is no religion there. Sort it out." This is a stupid comment because there is a CATHOLIC church next to religion title. This surely means that I am catholic. In addition, there was an OLS badge at the bottom of the page and if you know your schools, you will know it is a catholic school.  There are several things on my map that shows I am catholic so that is why the comment is stupid.

That is what I think about my comments and I hope I get more positive constructive comments than stupid ones.
