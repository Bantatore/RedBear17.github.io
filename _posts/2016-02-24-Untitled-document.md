When you put things on social media, you always get comments- sometimes they are good and sometimes they are bad.When I did my Identity map, I got positive constructive criticism comments, some stupid comments but not any rude fortunately. In this blog, I will say what I think about the comments people made on my identity map. In addition, I will talk about my identity map and how it has affected me.

When I created my identity map, I took a lot of time designing and drawing my map. However, I made a mistake as I did not do any writing. It was interesting to make my identity map as I found out about my family crest and other interesting facts. It took a lot of time and effort to make it but I did not write anything so it was not good. However, I improved it so it became a lot better. It felt a bit awkward that I was sharing it with the whole class so I could not include everything but I shared mostly everything. Most importantly, I included everything needed.

I would of rather asked questioms directly to the person as the person could not say something rude about your work in your face, they would have to use construtive critcism. Also, you could get more information of them than the sheet would give you. The process was different from reading something online as you can see the time put into the map on paper as something online can look amazing but only take 5 minutes as you can copy and paste. Also, you can not tell who wrote the comment online but on paper you can tell the persons handwriting and you can see them write it.

Doing the identity map made me realise that you should not put information about who you are online. You should not put your whole background online as people will know everything about you. This can be bad. I would change my blog to not have my name and email address on it because of this identity map. When I use social media in the future, because of this, I will be more safe and put on the write settings. I will also be careful on what I post.

From studying social media, I have realised not to put personal infomation on it. Also to only talk to friends you have met in real life and only let them see what you post. Social media can be dangerous if you talk or let the wrong people see your infomatiom and posts. I used to think that social media was safe and you could do what you want on it but I now know you have to be careful.

Now for the comments. Let's start of with the positive comments. Many people said that I spent lots of time on my work and it looked neat. People said my colouring was outstanding. People gave me constructive criticism. This was good as they told me improvements I could make in a non-rude way. For example, people told me to do more writing in a polite way.

However sadly, people were being just plain idiots. Some people said "It says religion but there is no religion there. Sort it out." This is a stupid comment because there is a CATHOLIC church next to religion title. This surely means that I am catholic. In addition, there was an OLS badge at the bottom of the page and if you know your schools, you will know it is a catholic school.  There are several things on my map that shows I am catholic so that is why the comment is stupid.

I felt that most of the comments were good constructive comments but one or two negative comments. The comments did not suprise me after as I realised that you needed writing. So overall, they were good. As you can see, my future social media use has been affected massively by the last 6 lessons.
