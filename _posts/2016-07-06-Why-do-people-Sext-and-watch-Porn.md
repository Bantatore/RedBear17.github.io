Sexting is wrong for people under 16 and is illegal. Porn is illegal for people under 18 to watch. However, why do people still watch/send this content. This blog will explain why people like to do these things.

It is natural for all human being to want sex. Everyone thinks about it and wants to do it. The reason pornography exists is because people want it. Many people who watch porn do it for enjoyment and many masterbate while watching it so they get the feeling of having sex. It gets people in the mood so they have an irrection and they can masterbate so they feel good. It is a good feeling masterbating for people as is feels like sex.

Young children do sexting as they want to have sex as well but they can not watch porn so the younger generation have made their own type of porn. It makes younger people feel "good" like porn. 

That is why people watch/send this porn/sexts- it is so they feel "good".
