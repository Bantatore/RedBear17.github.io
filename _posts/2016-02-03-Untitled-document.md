On social media, you got to be careful what to put on it. In the future, if you put inappropriate messages/images, you could not get a job for that. What you do online affects the real world massively. So, to keep you out of harm's way, here is what not to do on social media:

1. Don't put your phone number on media.

2. Don't put your address, email address on media as people can track you.

3. Only talk to people who you know in person; don't talk to a stranger.

4. Do not go to someone's house  who you met online.

5. Put your account on "friends only" (if you can) so only your friends know what you are doing.

6. Don't post on media that you are on holiday as your house is empty and people will know it and break into it.

7. Don't take a "sexy selfie" of yourself as your employer might not employ you for that.

8. Don't post anything inappropriate.

9. Have Fun!

So, that is not what to do to protect yourself in the future. However, most importantly, have fun!
