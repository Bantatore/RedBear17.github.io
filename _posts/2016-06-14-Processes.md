In computer programming, you have inputs, outputs and processes. This blog is going to be about the processes. Processes are by far the most important thing to programming. It is the building blocks to your program and the heart of what you're making. 

Processes are code. It is the code you use to get the program to do what you want. Without it your program can not function as it has no commands. Code is a command as you are telling the program to do what you want. It is like a baby-it needs to be told what to do. That is why it is the most important thing in programming.

Even though it is the most important, you still need inputs and outputs to make a successful program or game. However, the code allows the inputs and outputs to work. They can only function if the processes are correct. That is why inputs, outputs and processes are important in programming.
