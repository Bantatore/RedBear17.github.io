Using resources may seem obvious however, it sometimes is not. If you realise it is there, it can really help you in your work-particularly in coding. Instead of trying things that come of the top of your head that are useless and that get you nowhere, you can use the resources around you.

If you are stuck, go to your resources like books, previous work etc and use it to help you and inspire your work. It can give you the answer to your problem that you have probably  been working on for hours. That is why resources are very important.

As you can see, resources can change everything. They can make your work better, correct and good. Without them, you are more than likely going to fail in what you are doing. That is why you always have resources.
